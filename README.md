# C-_Game
Simple 2048 game created in C++
The only rule of the game is that you have to merge 2 tiles with the same numerical value and then
they become 1 tile with x2 of their original value then you have to merge this new x2 tile with
another x2 tile. The goal is to try and make 1 tile with as high of value as you can.
